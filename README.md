# my-first-discord-bot :robot::speech_balloon:
This is a Discord bot that responds to messages from members of a Discord server. It can say hello, post inspiring or encouraging messages, and greet new members. Members can also edit the bot by creating or deleting encouragement messages for the bot to use. This bot was implemented using discord.py.

This was made during Global Hack Week: AI/ML Week from Major League Hacking.
